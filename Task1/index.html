            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p><span>N</span>ikola Tesla, (born July 9/10, 1856, Smiljan, Austrian Empire [now in Croatia]—died January
                7, 1943, New York, New York, U.S.), Serbian American inventor and engineer who discovered and patented
                the rotating magnetic field, the basis of most alternating-current machinery. He also developed the
                three-phase system of electric power transmission. He immigrated to the United States in 1884 and sold
                the patent rights to his system of alternating-current dynamos, transformers, and motors to George
                Westinghouse. In 1891 he invented the Tesla coil, an induction coil widely used in radio technology.</p>

                                                in automobiles, Tesla decided to develop his own turbine-style engine.
                                                Also known as the boundary-layer turbine and cohesion-type turbine,
                                                Tesla’s turbine was distinct in its design. Unlike conventional turbines
                                                Tesla’s design was bladeless, instead employing smooth discs rotating in

                                                50 miles, from his lab at 33 and 35 South Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, to
                                                West Point, NY but disaster struck before his ground-breaking test could
                                                be completed: a building fire destroyed Tesla’s lab, taking his work
                                                with it. A year later, Marconi took out his first wireless telegram

This innovative powerhouse realised a long-held hope that the awesome force of Niagara Falls, one of North America’s most spectacular natural wonders, could be harnessed. </p>

Famously, German scientist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen developed the first X-ray on the 8 November of that same year, a ground-breaking achievement that earned him the inaugural Nobel Prize in 1901.</p>
